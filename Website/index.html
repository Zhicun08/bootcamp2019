<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp;Truth</h1>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BY GWENDOLYN BROOKS</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if sun comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How shall we greet him?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall we not dread him,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall we not fear him<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After so lengthy a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Session with shade?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though we have wept for
<a href="Anotherpoem.html">him</a>,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though we have prayed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All through the night-yearsâ€”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What if we wake one shimmering morning to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hear the fierce hammering<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his firm knuckles<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hard on the door?
