	<h1>Now</h1>
	<p>BY HILDA RAZ</p>
	Some problems of self-loathing, worry:<br>
the thumbnail blotched in a bank box<br>
door grows out, three-quarter moon marrow spot<br>
filled out with white bruise travels down<br>
my thumb at regular speed, so when I glance<br>
down it's what I see left of center, not<br>
the odd breast, the malformed scruff<br>
at head, the old thought leaking pain<br>
on the pages from my brain, which ought<br>
to be gainfully occupied with rain<br>
as an emblem of loss and gain, and is not.<br>
